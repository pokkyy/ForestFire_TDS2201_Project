# Forest Fire
> TDS2101 Data Science Fundamentals || Year 2 Trimester 2

# Introduction
For any forest dwellers and visitors, there always exists the chance of being unfortunate enough to be caught in a tragedy known as a forest fire. As the flames wreck havoc and destruction upon human life and the natural environment, one might wonder how things might turn out that way. By which it means, what factors come into play to cause such an event. This project aims to study the intensity of forest fires throughout the year and the elements that play a role in it.

The reasons such a subject should be studied is because of how something that is potentially preventable can easily disrupt our ecosystem, wildlife habitats, and destroy human lives. Besides that, the forest is filled with a plethora of natural resources. Damage caused by forest fires may lead to a significant economic impact on communities dependent on forest resources as a means of living. By studying the underlying nature and patterns of the factors that contribute to forest fires, we can create better strategies for prevention and early detection of these hazardous events.

A study on the relationship between forest fires, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) indices, and weather conditions include exploratory data analysis, feature understanding, feature relationship, feature selection, and model construction and comparison. The initial steps will uncover the underlying patterns found within these variables. From our findings, we will then be able to make prediction models based on key features. Several models are created and a comparison of performance will be performed in order to find the most accurate method of forecasting forest fires.

# Objectives
1. Analyse the relationship between a forest fire and the elements that contribute to it which are the Fire Weather Index (FWI), and the weather conditions.
2. Uncover the patterns and nature of forest fires, allowing us to understand the correlation between the FWI, weather conditions, months of the year, and the fires themselves.
3. Ranking the intensity of the fires based on the area burned and the FWI index, allowing us to discover the intensity of a forest fire that leads to a large amount of area burned.

# Project Output
1. Provide insights and information on weather conditions that have the most influential impact on a forest fire, and understand its relationship with the FWI as a means of better comprehending forest fire behaviour.
2. Forecast which months of the year would a forest fire most likely occur. Identification of this period allows us to take a
more precautious approach and provide additional resources to be prepared in forest fire prevention.
